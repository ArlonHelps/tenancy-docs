    An introduction to the Tenancy ecosystem.

# Introduction
Tenancy is developed as a small ecosystem. It's a set of products/packages that are all focused on one simple thing: Providing you the best way to get multi-tenancy working in your application.

## The idea
The general idea of Tenancy is to give a really powerful modular way of getting multi-tenancy working in **any** Laravel application.

By using a modular approach we allow you to select only the components you need for your specific application. This allows you to only implement the specific functions you need without being forced to implement additional functionality changing how your application works.
