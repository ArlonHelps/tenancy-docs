We do our best to provide clear guidelines on how we collaborate on our packages. This is not always easy as opinions differ, we nevertheless try to stick to these guidelines as much as we can:

- We configured StyleCI to automatically patch code changes, including those in PR's. This allows us to focus on the quality of the code, instead of the cosmetics.
- StyleCI is configured to use the [recommended preset](https://docs.styleci.io/presets#recommended), feel free to read over them and adopt the guidelines you agree with.
- Do not change styling of code outside of your changes, this makes it incredibly hard to review pull requests.
