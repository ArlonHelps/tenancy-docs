Let's start by saying the Tenancy packages would never have
existed without the investment made by team members and many
community members. 

Even though everyone in the team is a developer, not everyone
plays a role in development, here's what our team takes care of;

- **Package maintenance**. Taking care of bugs and keeping up with
new releases of the Laravel framework.
- **Feature development**. Adding or extending functionality in our
packages.
- **Support**. Helping other developers with their implementation through
our chat server, GitHub issues or discussion forum.
- **Project planning**. Carving out new releases and describing the best path
forward is a necessity for our project.
- **Communication**. With new releases comes the responsibility to inform
our community about them and the changes they hold. We also do our best
to respond to twitter messages related to our packages and promoting them.
- **Documentation**. We hope to focus actual support to specific questions.
Every regular question and the package fundamentals are written down in 
clear, understandable articles in our documentation.

It would seem that only code-related roles are important to a package. But
that's not the case. We are exceptionally proud of the people providing
support, they are experienced with the package and patiently assist people
at different levels of skill and implementation without losing their cool.

We strongly dislike hierarchy, preferring an open, transparent team environment. Team
members are valued for their opinion. In fact, all team members are equals and even our founder prefers being a
"[Primus inter pares](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primus_inter_pares)" or first among equals!

**Thank you for your dedication for any and all contributions!**
